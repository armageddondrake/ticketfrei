<h1>Features</h1>
<p>
    Don't pay for public transport. Instead, warn each other
    from ticket controllers! With Ticketfrei, you can turn
    your city into a paradise for fare dodgers.
</p>
<p>
    Ticketfrei is a Twitter, Mastodon, and E-Mail bot. Users
    can help each other by tweeting, tooting, or mailing,
    when and where they spot a ticket controller.
</p>
<p>
    Ticketfrei automatically retweets, boosts, and remails
    those controller reports, so others can see them. If there
    are ticket controllers around, they can still buy a ticket
    - but if the coast is clear, they can save the money.
</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
    text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
    from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
    McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
    Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
    the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered
    the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
    1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
    (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
    BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
    popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem
    Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
    in section 1.10.32.</p>

Ticketfrei Community Code of Conduct
====================================

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers strive to make participation in the Ticketfrei
community a pleasurable, harassment-free experience.


Our Standards
-------------

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Showing empathy towards community members and newcomers
* Helping and mediating in cases of upsets or conflict

Examples of behavior which we ask everybody to avoid include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other behaviour which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

We recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day, or may be unaware of
the impact of their behaviour. When that happens, you may carefully remind
them in public or private, whatever is more appropriate. Assume good faith;
it's more likely that participants are unaware than that they are intentionally
trying to denigrate others or reduce the quality of discussion.


Maintainers and Responsibilities
--------------------------------

Project maintainers are those with commit rights to Ticketfrei. Each
maintainer is asked to take responsibility and appropriate, careful action in
response to witnessed instances of questionable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

They may also ban temporarily or permanently a contributor for other behaviors
that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies both within project communication channels and
gatherings as well as in public spaces when an individual is representing the
project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community
include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official
social media account, or acting as an representative at an online or offline
event.

Reporting and Responses
-----------------------

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting select project maintainers, currently
tech@lists.links-tech.org. They will review reports and involve other
maintainers as appropriate, resulting in a response that is deemed neccessary
and appropriate to the circumstances. 

Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the
reporter of an incident. Maintainers are themselves not exempt from being
reported about and may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined
by other maintainers.
